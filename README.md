### About me: @pepershukov  
I am **Peter**, else simply **pep3rs**.

I am coding on **Python** _(as of now)_. **All my projects** I ever did are in **that language**.
My biggest project so far is the [Discord bot of mine](https://top.gg/bot/789102405944868865) _(now discontinued for other things)_ for simplified use of Discord or the [YouTube Music - 'Your Likes' Downloader](https://github.com/pepershukov/ytm-yl-downloader).

**Games** that **I play**:  
_**Note:** they are all free to play (F2P)._
